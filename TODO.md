* Solve the charge and spin multicpltiy problem for each fragment problem(Still don't know how to do this yet?)[VeryHard]
* Test it on the DP and GAP neural network for training(Already written up, just need to update to support online active learning format rather than batch format)[Easy]

[Dec 6th]
* My data and graphs finished and ready to present.(See Dec 1st)[Easy]
